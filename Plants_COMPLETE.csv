It belongs to the buttercup family, and its shiny yellow flowers indeed look very much like buttercups. It typically grows 12-18” tall on hollow, branching stems. Bright yellow flowers (1-2” diameter) with 5-9 waxy deep yellow petal-like sepals bloom in spring (April to June). Flowers give way to seed pods which split open when ripe to disperse the seeds within. Long-stalked, rounded to cordate, glossy green basal leaves (to 7” across) attain mature size in summer well after flowering. Upper stem leaves are smaller and stalkless. Flower buds may be cooked and pickled in vinegar for use as a substitute for capers. Young leaves are also edible as cooked greens when boiled. No part of this plant should ever be eaten raw however.","Herbaceous, Perennial, Nonpersistent",Birds,"Labrador to Alaska, south to Newfoundland, Nova Scotia, south Carolina,",https://www.missouribotanicalgarden.org/PlantFinder/PlantFinderDetails.aspx?taxonid=286073,https://www.wildflower.org/plants/result.php?id_plant=capa5,Herbaceous Perennials,HERBACEOUS PERENNIALS

It is noted for its excellent spring flowers and quality year round foliage. It typically grows as a dense rounded shrub to 5-15’ tall, opening up and developing gnarly branches with age. Notwithstanding its usual shrub habit, mountain laurel will rarely grow as a small tree (particularly on slopes in the Appalachian Mountains) to as much as 30’ tall. Flowers appear in terminal clusters (corymbs to 6” across), typically covering the shrub in late May-June for several weeks with an often exceptional bloom. Each flower (to 1” across) is cup shaped with five sides and ranges in color from rose to white with purple markings inside. If not deadheaded, flowers give way to non-showy brown fruits (3/16” dehiscent capsules) that persist into winter. Elliptic, alternate, leathery, glossy evergreen leaves (to 5” long) are dark green above and yellow green beneath and reminiscent to the leaves of rhododendrons.

It also tolerates periodic flooding, but will not grow in soils where the roots are submerged in water. Root rot is less likely to occur with this species. Prefers a sun dappled shade or high open part shade. Foliage may scorch in full sun unless soils are kept uniformly moist. Roots must never be allowed to dry out. Acidify soils prior to planting and thereafter as needed. This azalea should never be planted near a black walnut or butternut tree (roots of both trees produce toxic juglones which will typically damage or kill rhododendrons/azaleas growing within or close to the drip line of either tree). It is best sited in a location protected from strong winter winds. This shrub has a shallow, fibrous root system (do not cultivate around the shrub) and will benefit from a good mulch (wood chips, bark or pine needles) for retention of moisture, stabilization of soil temperatures and winter protection. Clip off spent flower clusters immediately after bloom as practicable. Plants will slowly naturalize by root suckers.","Broad-leaved, deciduous shrub","Hummingbirds, Butterflies","Maine to Ohio, south to Florida",https://www.missouribotanicalgarden.org/plantfinder/PlantFinderDetails.aspx?taxonid=280018,https://www.wildflower.org/plants/result.php?id_plant=rhvi2,Shrubs,SHRUBS
