Prefers moist, loamy soils. Tolerates some drought. When grown in full sun, plants often require no pruning or staking. When grown in some shade and/or in rich soils, however, plants tend to become more open and floppy and often require staking or pruning. For a neater appearance, particularly for shade-grown plants, consider cutting back stems by 1/2 to 1/3 after flowering to promote bushy growth and, if desired, a more rounded foliage mound. Although cutting back most Amsonias to 6-8"" after bloom is recommended in order to help maintain neatness and increase foliage density, such trimming is usually not needed in the case of this compact cultivar.","Borders, rock gardens, cottage gardens, open woodland areas, rain gardens.
